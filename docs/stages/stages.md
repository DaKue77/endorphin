# Stages

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Endorphin was designed to be progressively upgraded--so you can get started with minimal cost and time, then upgrade further if you wish. Each stage will drop more moving weight, but will also require more materials and printed parts.

| Stage     | Moving Weight Reduction | Cost    |
| :-------- | :---------------------- | :------ |
| 1         | 215g                    | $21     |
| 2         | 270g                    | $38     |
| 3         | 90g[^1]                 | $16     |
| **Total** | **575g**                | **$75** |

> Note: Weight reduction and cost of each stage are listed relative to the stage before it (rather than cumulatively). Grand totals of all the stages are added up in the final row of this table:

[^1]: Because stage 3 adds a linear rail to the X axis, the weight of the new rail does negate the weight saved by dropping the v-slot printhead carriage.
