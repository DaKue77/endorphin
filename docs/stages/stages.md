# Stages

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Endorphin was designed to be progressively upgraded--so you can get started with minimal cost and time, then upgrade at your own pace. Each stage will drop more moving weight, but will also require more materials and printed parts.

> Note: Weight reduction and cost of each stage are listed individually from the stage before it. Grand totals of all the stages are added up in the final row.
{: .fs-4 .fw-300 }

| Stage     | Moving Weight Reduction | Cost             | Print Time |

[^1]: Because stage 3 adds a linear rail to the X axis, the weight of the new rail does negate the weight saved by dropping the v-slot printhead carriage. This stage isn't as much about dropping weight as the other two stages were. The benefits of this stage are mainly more print consistency on the X axis, access to the awesome Ratrig and Vz printheads, and complete liberation from those v-slot wheels.
