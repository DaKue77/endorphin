# Endorphin for MicroSwiss NG Direct Driver Extruder (Linear Rail Edition)

This is a fork to enable the use of a Linear Rail Edition Micro-swiss NG direct drive extruder.

REMARK: You will need to use a MGN12 linear rail on your x-axis to make the NG extruder fit.

Changes:
1. Added alternative y-endstop to allow the full print area to be used (220x220x300)
2. Added alternative tensioner knob with 12mm height to allow for more clearance between belt and tensioner bolt
3. Added y-axis belt tensioner for left side
4. Added STEP model including above changes and NG direct drive extruder 

This is the repo for both the CAD files and the docs for the Endorphin project. Docs are built and published [here](https://endorphin3d.com/docs).
